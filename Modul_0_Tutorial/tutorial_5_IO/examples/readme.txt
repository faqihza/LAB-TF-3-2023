The examples in this folder simply create an instrument object (e.g.,
"vps", " dmm"), change some values, and show how to use some of their 
methods where appropriate. They do not do any cleanup, meaning that 
the instrument  object is not deleted. This is intended for tutorial 
purposes, so that you can see and interact with the instrument object
after running the script.

In general, however, it is good practice to delete the instrument 
objects once you are done with them.
